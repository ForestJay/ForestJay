### Hello GitHub ðŸ‘‹

The best way to learn more about me is by visiting my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/foresthandford/). I currently work at [Dutchie](https://dutchie.com). I just finished working at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) and prior to that I worked at [Affectiva](https://affectiva.com). I'm also a volunteer programmer for [Employee Empowerment](https://github.com/EmployeeEmpowerment/EmpEmp/). I've published a few books which you can learn about on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17255626.Forest_J_Handford).
